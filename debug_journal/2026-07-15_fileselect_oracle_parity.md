# 2026-07-15 — File-select parity vs the oracle: mostly faithful, 3 real residuals

User directive: file-select parity, compare against the oracle. Built the oracle harness,
captured both sides at FULL RES, and compared. The file-select (stage-15 save-blocks,
reached by pressing START at the title) renders the full beach/ocean/sky/palm scene + the
"Select data." UI faithfully. There ARE real residuals (below).

## ⚠️ Downscaled/`_640` captures LIED — always compare at full res

Early `_640` downscales showed a WHITE background + "faded" Mario and I nearly chased a
"missing background" defect. Both were DOWNSCALE ARTIFACTS: the full-res native
(`scratch/shots/fsel_blocks_1400.png`) clearly renders the whole beach scene, and Mario is
fine (his big white gloves are correct). A naive pixel-diff was ALSO junk (67% "different")
because native dumps 1280x960 (480 lines) and the aurora replay dumps 1280x896 (448 EFB
lines) — scaling both to a common size vertically MISALIGNS every UI element. LESSON: view
full res; for a real pixel diff, capture both sides at the SAME height first.

## The oracle harness (durable, reusable)

File-select is INPUT-GATED (needs a START press) so the deterministic field-count fifo
recorder can't reach it. Added to the Dolphin fork (now a SUBMODULE): DolphinNoGUI
**`--pad-start-at <field> --pad-start-frames <n>`** (fork 2059b5b) injects a headless GC
START over a VI-field window (CSIDevice_GCController::GetPadStatus), driven by the existing
vi_end_field counter. Working recipe:
`--pad-start-at=7300 --pad-start-frames=20 --fifo-record-after=7800 --fifo-record-frames=3`
(START ≥7300 reaches the save-blocks = ~3040 draws; 6800 was too early = settled title,
1258 draws). Replay the .dff through aurora (`SB_FIFO_REPLAY=...dff SB_SYNC_PIPELINES=1`) =
pixel oracle. Cached: `scratch/oracle/fifo/fsel_try_7300.dff`.
Native: `SB_STAGE=15 SB_PAD_SCRIPT="600:START 610:-" SB_DUMP_FRAME=... SB_DUMP_FRAME_AFTER=1400`.

## Real residuals (native vs oracle, both full-res) — the parity worklist

1. **Ocean sun-glare missing.** Oracle sea has bright white sun-glint/foam across the
   mid-distance water; native sea is a uniform saturated turquoise (no glare). = the
   reflective-sea sun-glint/additive-ripple path (TMapObjWave / TMirrorCamera / sea notes)
   not fully rendering here.
2. **Palm tree under-lit.** Native palm TRUNK is a dark near-black silhouette + fronds dark
   green; oracle trunk is light/textured + fronds lighter. Native palm is too dark
   (lighting or the trunk texture/material).
3. **A/B/C file cubes under-lit.** Native cubes are darker/dimmer brown; oracle cubes are
   brighter golden. Same darkening as the palm — likely a shared scene-lighting/ambient
   difference on the file-select 3D objects.

Not defects: file-block content (native all "New" = blank save is correct; oracle slot 1 =
shine×01 from Dolphin's memcard) and Mario anim-pose (mismatched capture instants).

## ROOT CAUSE of residuals 2+3 (palm + cubes under-lit): AMBIENT COLOR loads as 0

Dual per-draw state dump (SB_DRAW_DUMP, native file-select vs oracle .dff replay) nailed it.
The dominant lit-perspective draw signature:
- ORACLE: `ch0[light=1 matSrc=0 ambSrc=0 mat=(1,1,1,1) amb=(0.50,0.50,0.50) mask=03]`
- NATIVE: `ch0[light=1 matSrc=0 ambSrc=0 mat=(1,1,1,1) amb=(0.00,0.00,0.00) mask=03]`

The ONLY difference is the **ambient color: 0.5 (oracle) vs 0.0 (native)**. With lit,
matSrc/ambSrc=REG, output = mat×(ambient + Σlights); native's zero ambient makes every
not-directly-lit surface (palm trunk, shadowed cube faces) render BLACK — exactly the
symptom. This is almost certainly NOT file-select-specific — it's every lit J3D scene
(the title just has few lit-3D draws so it hid there). HIGH VALUE fix.

Narrowing (do NOT rush — a wrong swap here breaks ALL model loading):
- The material ambient comes from `J3DMaterial::load` (J3DMaterial.cpp:274-276 emits
  `mAmbColor[i].color` via J3DGDSetChanAmbColor), set from `J3DMaterialFactory::newAmbColor`
  (J3DMaterialFactory.cpp:242) = `mpAmbColor[initData->mAmbColorIdx[stage]]` (or the default).
- The default is `j3dDefaultAmbInfo = {0x32,0x32,0x32,0x32}` (≈0.2) — so native's 0.00 is NOT
  the default fallback; native reads `mpAmbColor[idx] == 0` where the oracle's is 0x80. Same
  BMD, so native's ambient LOAD is wrong: either the u16 `mAmbColorIdx` reads byte-swapped
  (BMD MAT3 is big-endian) → wrong entry, or `block.mpAmbColor` offset resolves wrong (LP64),
  or the MAT3 swapper (`readMaterial`) doesn't cover the ambient array/indices. `matColor`
  reads white in both, but that's the newMatColor default (0xFF), so it doesn't prove the
  index path works.
- NEXT DIAGNOSTIC (before fixing): for one file-select material, print native's
  `mpAmbColorNum`, the `mpAmbColor[]` entries, and `initData->mAmbColorIdx[0]` — compare to
  the raw BMD MAT3 bytes. That says definitively index-swap vs array-offset vs default-path.

## Other residuals

- Residual 1 (ocean sun-glare) = the existing reflective-sea arc (separate).
- For a clean quantified pixel diff, first fix the capture-height mismatch (dump native at
  448 or the oracle at 480) — the 960-vs-896 misalignment inflated the earlier 67% number.
